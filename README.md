# Threat Event (Unauthorized Chrome Extension Abuse)  
**Malicious Google Chrome Extension Installation and Use**

## Reason for the Hunt:
**Management Directive following Cybersecurity News Alert**  
After multiple cybersecurity outlets reported on malicious Chrome extensions capable of stealing data and monitoring user behavior, management requested a threat hunt across all endpoints to detect unauthorized or suspicious Chrome extensionsâ€”especially those not approved by IT or installed outside the Chrome Web Store.

---

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took to Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Downloaded a suspicious Chrome extension `.crx` file from a third-party website.
2. Enabled **Developer Mode** in Chrome and manually installed the extension.
3. The extension began logging user keystrokes and browsing behavior.
4. The attacker browsed internal company systems to capture sensitive information.
5. The extension attempted to connect to an external C2 (Command and Control) server (e.g., `http://malicious-extension-leak[.]xyz/api/steal`)
6. A temporary local storage file `extension-activity-log.json` was created.
7. The user deleted the `.crx` installer afterward.
